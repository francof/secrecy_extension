secrecy_extension
=================

A basic challenge based encryption extension for chrome. 
Uses SJCL to do all the heavy lifting, caveat emptor: http://www.matasano.com/articles/javascript-cryptography/

The extension will provide some secrecy in inputs/forms. 
If you doubt the website you are visiting will read/share your text, this will make it hard for them to do so.

You can still share your text to people with a pass and the extension (or yourself).

This is a very early project.

## Installing

Requires bower for installing SJCL

## License
